## Introduction

Deploying Azure Sentinel with a Honeypot for Threat Visualization

A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system is a security solution that enables organizations to detect, analyze, and respond to potential threats before they impact business operations. It works by collecting and correlating event log data from various sources across a network, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and identity management tools. This centralized visibility allows security professionals to monitor, prioritize, and remediate threats in real time.

A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable system designed to attract and study malicious activity within a safe, controlled environment. It serves as a valuable tool for analyzing attacker behavior, identifying new threat vectors, and enhancing cybersecurity strategies.




<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This setup leverages the 30-day free trial offered by Microsoft Sentinel, making it an accessible and cost-effective platform for hands-on cybersecurity training and real-time threat analysis. In this project we will be following a tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshMadakor">Josh Madakor</a>

<b>This demo showcases the use of Azure Sentinel (SIEM) integrated with a live Windows VM honeypot to monitor and analyze real-time RDP brute-force attacks from around the globe.


üõ† What It Does

Parses Windows Event Logs for failed RDP login attempts

Uses a PowerShell script to extract attacker IP addresses

Queries a third-party API to retrieve geolocation data

Plots attack sources on an Azure Sentinel map dashboard

üåê Why It Matters

This project provides hands-on experience with threat detection, log analysis, and real-time SIEM data visualization using cloud-native tools.
